# How It Works Documentation

![How It Works](../assets/img/how-it-works.svg)

This document details the structure and intent of the "How It Works" subpage.

## Overview
The "How It Works" page serves as an educational deep-dive into the methodology of the AlignSynch platform. While the home page provides a high-level summary, this page is intended to walk potential users through the specific mechanics of the "Alignment" process.

## Page Structure

### 1. Header Section
- **Title:** "How AlignSynch Works"
- **Subtitle:** "A deeper dive into the methodology of alignment."
- **Intent:** Sets a professional, educational tone distinct from the marketing-heavy home page.

### 2. Coming Soon Placeholder
- **Component:** A highlighted box using `bg-cyan-50`.
- **Content:** "Detailed content coming soon."
- **Intent:** Explicitly informs early access users that the documentation is evolving.

### 3. The Three-Step Process Grid
A visual breakdown of the core user journey:
1.  **Express (Green)**: The solitary act of recording one's own truth.
2.  **Invite (Cyan)**: The bridge building act of bringing another person into the system.
3.  **Synch (Purple)**: The collaborative act of resolution.

## Component Implementation
- **File:** `pages/HowItWorksPage.tsx`
- **Route:** `/how-it-works`
- **Key Styling:** Uses `prose` (typography plugin concept) for readable long-form text.

## Future Enhancements
- Video tutorials embedding.
- Interactive "sample opinion" sliders.
- FAQ accordion specific to the methodology.
